Sets up the targetProfile.json for the "profile".jar that will be imported into IGI, 
provided that you already have all the other files ready for it.

such as my_project_folder/my_project_folder/, run the following from the root of the project:
.\profile_creator.bat .\my_project_folder .\targetprovidercreator_folder
